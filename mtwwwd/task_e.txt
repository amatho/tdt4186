This security problem can be exploited in our implementation by writing '../' in the request, moving
upwards in the directory heirarchy from the webroot directory, or by passing the absoulute path,
starting with '//' (an extra forward slash, since HTTP paths always begin with a forward slash).

The first solution to this problem is input sanitizing. By removing leading '/', and removing
strings of '../' in the request path, the input is sanitized and can be safely used to open files.
This is the solution we have implemented in our source code.

Another way to prevent access to files outside the webroot directory is to use the chroot Unix command,
which changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program 
that is run in this modified environment cannot access files utside the designated directory tree.
